#Assignment 2
##Anscombe Dataset:
```{r quick_look, echo = TRUE}
data("anscombe")                      #loading anscombe dataset
dim(anscombe)                         #dimensions of dataset
names(anscombe)                       #column titles
head(anscombe, n = 6)                 #first 6 rows of dataset
tail(anscombe, n = 6)                 #last 6 rows of dataset
summary(anscombe)                     #summary of entire layout of dataset
```

#Assignment 3

data("anscombe")
plot(x = anscombe$x1, y = anscombe$y1)        #to plot a scatter plot
fit <- lm(anscombe$y1 ~ anscombe$x1)          #line of best fit
abline(fit)
```
Figure 1: Scatter plot showing Anscombe dataset, with line of regression of y1 on x1.

#Assignment 4
##Analgesic dataset import:
```{r data_import (chunk 1), echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
df <- read_csv("analgesic.csv")               #load analgesic dataset
```

##Analgesic dataset summary
```{r data_summary (chunk 2), echo = TRUE}
dim(df)                                       #dimensions of dataset
names(df)                                     #column titles
head(df, n = 6)                               #first 6 rows of dataset
tail(df, n = 6)                               #last 6 rows of dataset
summary(df)                                   #summary of entire layout
```

##Analgesic dataset grouped by measurements
```{r data_tidy (chunk 3), echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
gathered <- gather(data = df,
                   key = measurement, 
                   value = data, Measurement_1:Measurement_3,
                   na.rm = FALSE,
                   convert = FALSE,
                   factor_key = FALSE)        #gather into measurement column
by_id <- group_by(gathered, ID)               #group by subect ID
report <- summarize(by_id, mean(data))        #average of measurements by_id
report                                        #print results
```

#Assignment 5
##Chicken weights
**Null hypothesis:** Chicken feed has no effect on chicken weight

**Alternative hypothesis:** Chicken feed has a direct effect on chicken weight

Unpaired, Parametric data set with more than 2 groups therefore a One-Way ANOVA is required to test hypothesis.

Significance interval set at 95%, df = 5.

If p value < F-value then reject null hypothesis.
``` {r chicken (chunk 1), echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
df_chicken <- read_csv("chick-weights.csv")           #load dataset
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = df_chicken)             #parametric check
chicken_test <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = df_chicken) #1-way ANOVA test
summary(chicken_test)                                 #summary of test
```
F-value = 15.37 , p-value = 5.94e-10. p< F, therefore reject null hypothesis.

Therefore we can conclude that chicken feed has a direct effect on chicken weight.

##The Hot Zone
**Null hypothesis:** Drinking water does not cause gastroenteritis.

**Alternative hypothesis:** Drinking water did cause gastroenteritis.

Unpaired, non-parametric, categorical dataset. Therefore a Fisher's Exact test will be used to test hypothesis.

Significance interval set at 95%, reject null hypothesis if p < 0.05
``` {r hot (chunk 2), echo = TRUE}
df_hot <- read_csv("gastroenteritis.csv")             #load dataset
df_table <- table(df_hot$Consumption, df_hot$Outcome) #create contiguency tab
hot_test <- fisher.test(df_table)                     #Fishers test
hot_test
```
p = 2.2e-16 therefore reject null hypothesis.

In conclusion the drinking water did cause gasteroenteritis.


##Nausea
**Null hypothesis:** 5HT3 receptor blocker does not reduce nausea in breast cancer patients.

**Alternative hypthesis:** 5HT3 receptor blocker does reduce nausea in breast cancer patients.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Paired, non-parametric (after adjustments), ordinal dataset. Therefore a Wilcox rank test is required.

Significance interval set at 95%, reject null hypothesis if p < 0.05
``` {r nausea, echo = TRUE}
df_nausea <- read_csv("nausea.csv")           #load dataset
nausea_new <- df_nausea[-8,-1]                #exclude outlier
nausea_new
boxplot(nausea_new)                           #parametric check
wilcox.test(nausea_new$Nausea_before, nausea_new$Nausea_after, paired=TRUE)   #Wilcox stat test
```
p-value = 0.04983, therefore reject null hypothesis.

In conclusion the 5Ht3 receptor blocker does reduce nausea in breast cancer patients.


#Assignment 6
##House Prices
**Null hypothesis:** Interest rate does not affect the price of houses (USD).

**Alternative hypothesis:** Interest rate does affect the price of houses (USD)

**Assumptions:**

> Interest rate and House prices (USD) are in interval scale

> There are no outliers

> The interest rates are independent to house price without measurment error.

> The residuals are normally distributed, because they do fit on a  normal Q-Q plot.

> Thus the residuals are homoskadastic as they show spread around the 0 abline.

> Therefore a Pearson's correlation is required to analyse data.


Reject null hypothesis if rho = 0. Significance set to p < 0.05.
``` {r house, echno = TRUE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, fig.path = './figures/', dev = 'svg'}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
df_house <- read_csv("housing-prices.csv")              #load dataset
head(df_house, 4)                                       #First 4 rows of dataset
plot(df_house$interest_rate, df_house$median_house_price_USD,
     main = 'Interest rates plotted against housing prices',
     xlab = 'Interest rate (%)', ylab = 'Median house price (USD)',
     xlim = c(5,10), ylim = c(150000,330000))             #scatter plot of dataset

house_fit <- lm(median_house_price_USD ~ interest_rate, data = df_house)  #regression line of dataset
abline(house_fit)                                       #plotted regression line
summary(house_fit)                                      #summary of regression 


plot(x = house_fit$fitted, y = house_fit$residuals)     #Check homoskedasticity
abline(h = 0)

qqnorm(house_fit$residuals)                   #check for Gaussian residual distribution
qqline(house_fit$residuals)                   


house_test <- with(df_house,
                   cor.test(x = interest_rate, y = median_house_price_USD,
                            method = 'pearson'))       #Spearman correlation test
house_test                                              #Print out stats summary
``` 
Rho not equal to zero, df = 14, p = 0.01937, therefore reject null hypothesis.

In conclusion interest rate does influence the price of houses (USD).
